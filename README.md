  # BURGER QUEEN üçî
This application was born from our client's need to effectively manage the service within their fast-food restaurant. To achieve this, we followed UX|UI guidelines, creating patterns and developing efficiently according to each user's needs. As a result, we achieved a responsive app for both tablets and computers, providing an ideal platform that is dynamic and highly intuitive!!

  ***You can try the app by clicking on the burger icon:***  ----->
